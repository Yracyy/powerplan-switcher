# PowerPlan Switcher

A lightweight PowerShell utility that automatically switches your Windows power plan based on whether your laptop is plugged in or running on battery — no manual toggling required.

## Why I built this

Windows doesn't offer a native way to auto-switch power plans on AC/battery change (only per-app settings like NVIDIA/AMD Optimus profiles). I wanted my performance plan active only while plugged in, and a battery-friendly plan to kick in automatically the moment I unplug — so I built a small background watcher for it.

## How it works

- `PowerPlanSwitcher.ps1` polls the system's battery status every few seconds using `Get-CimInstance`.
- When it detects a change between AC and battery power, it calls `powercfg /setactive` to switch to the plan you've configured for that state.
- Every switch is timestamped and logged to a log file for easy troubleshooting.
- `Install-PowerPlanSwitcher.ps1` copies the script to `C:\Scripts` and registers it as a Task Scheduler task that runs silently at every logon.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell 5.1+
- Administrator privileges (for Task Scheduler registration)
- A laptop with a battery (obviously)

## Setup

1. **Find your power plan GUIDs:**

   ```powershell
   powercfg /list
   ```

   This lists all available power plans with their GUIDs. Common built-in ones:

   | Plan             | GUID                                   |
   |------------------|------------------------------------------|
   | Balanced         | `381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e`   |
   | Power saver      | `a1841308-3541-4fab-bc81-f71556f20b4a`   |
   | High performance | `8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c`   |

   (Custom plans created by tools like Armoury Crate, MSI Center, etc. will show their own GUIDs.)

2. **Clone this repo:**

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/powerplan-switcher.git
   cd powerplan-switcher
   ```

3. **Run the installer** (as Administrator), passing in your chosen GUIDs:

   ```powershell
   .\Install-PowerPlanSwitcher.ps1 -BatteryPlanGUID "a1841308-3541-4fab-bc81-f71556f20b4a" -ACPlanGUID "381b4222-f694-41f0-9685-ff5bb260df2e"
   ```

   This copies the script to `C:\Scripts\PowerPlanSwitcher.ps1` and registers a scheduled task that runs it at every logon.

## Usage

Once installed, it runs silently in the background — no interaction needed. Unplug or plug in your laptop and the active power plan switches automatically within a few seconds.

Logs are written to:
```
C:\Logs\PowerPlanSwitcher\switcher.log
```

## Manually running without installing

You can also just run the script directly, without registering a scheduled task:

```powershell
.\PowerPlanSwitcher.ps1 -BatteryPlanGUID "<your-battery-guid>" -ACPlanGUID "<your-ac-guid>"
```

## Uninstall

```powershell
Unregister-ScheduledTask -TaskName "PowerPlanSwitcher" -Confirm:$false
Remove-Item "C:\Scripts\PowerPlanSwitcher.ps1"
```

## Notes

- Execution policy: if you get a "running scripts is disabled" error, unblock the downloaded files first:
  ```powershell
  Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File
  ```
- Tested on my ASUS ROG Strix laptop with hybrid Optimus graphics. Should work on other devices too.
